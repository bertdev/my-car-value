## Description

This project consists of an API where a user can search for an average value to sell his vehicle. 

This user provides some information about his car (year, model, mileage, make, and so on) and receives as an answer a value to sell his car based on other reports of prices for similar vehicles in our database. 

When he manages to sell, he can send a report so that the data from this sale will help the posterior users and this data will be analyzed and approved by an admin user.

In this project, I learn more about nest concepts like guards, interceptors, data serialization, cookies, config module, custom components, and so forth.
